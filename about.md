Hi, I'm Ian. I have been maintaining this blog since 2018. I'm glad to share
with you in my personal website what I've learned recently.

The tag line of this website is a Latin phrase: *simplex sigillum veri*. It
means *simplicity is the sign of truth*. Martin Kleppmann quotes the following
phrase in his book *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*, indicating that this
idiom also applies to software development:

> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple
> system that works. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: A
> complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work.

> -- John Gall, *Systemantics*
